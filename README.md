# [Powerflutter](https://www.powerflutter.com)

Powerflutter is an easy to use yet powerful framework for Flutter & Dart focussing on developer productivity.

Powerflutter wants to be what Rails is for Ruby, the go to Framework that makes all common Tasks easier. The focus is keeping things simple, developer productivity high, writing less boilerplate code, and getting maintainable, testable code.

Powerflutter will in the future give you the option to write your custom server code in dart using the Powerflutter Server Library. 

Furthermore Powerflutter has an optional code generation library that will generate any even so small boilerplate code and typed references to assets like images, sounds or localizations instead of manually added string based approaches which break easily and dont have compile time checks.

    [ ] DB Integrations / ORM / Querying 

## Optional Powerflutter.com hosted Services:
    [ ] Service for remote Localization updates. Change your Strings on the fly or add new languages not App Update needed. Full offline capable fallback and only send the minimum updates needed.

    [ ] Service for remote Configuration Updates, 
    [ ] Replace Images, Sounds on the fly

[ ] more examples
